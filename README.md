# Bubblemath

BubbleMath is a computer-based video game developed by TEAM 7. It is a game used primarily to improve the math abilities in pre-high school children, before they reach middle school.
The main purpose of this game isn't only to improve math abilities but also prepare the students for middle school, as well as making the base knowledge stronger for future accomplishments.
We made this game as a project that is part of the Software Engineering unit in Sami Shamoon college of Engineering.

In order to achieve victory, all you have to do is shoot the bubble with the correct answer to the equation it fits the best.
Example: 
Receiving the number '2' in the bubble-shooter, will fit perfectly for the following equation: '2X=4'.

Once the correct answer hits the equation, an indication will pop up and the score will raise.

## Donations:
Occasionally we are asked if we accept donations to support the development. While we appreciate the thought, maintaining PTB is our hobby and we have almost no running costs for it. We therefore have nothing set up to accept donations. If you still want to donate, we kindly ask you to donate to another open source project/initiative of your choice instead.
